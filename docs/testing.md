### Unit testing 
All unit tests should be located in the same folder with tested component, and should have `spec` separated by dots in filename (Example: `app.component.spec.ts`). For now [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) is the only test framework used.
   
```
# running tests while developing
npm run test:dev

# single tests run
npm run test

# single tests run with code coverage output
npm run test:coverage
```
